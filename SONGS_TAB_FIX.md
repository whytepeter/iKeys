# Songs Tab - Published Recordings Fix

## 🐛 Issue
The Songs tab was only showing the 6 predefined songs, not the published recordings from users.

## ✅ Solution
Updated the Songs tab template to handle both `Song` and `RecordingDocument` types.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Type Guard Function**
```typescript
const isRegularSong = (item: Song | RecordingDocument): item is Song => {
  return 'artist' in item && 'tempo' in item && 'chords' in item;
};
```

This function checks if an item is a regular song or a published recording.

### 2. **Unified Click Handler**
```typescript
const handleSongOrRecordingClick = (item: Song | RecordingDocument) => {
  if (isRegularSong(item)) {
    selectSong(item);        // Regular songs
  } else {
    playRecording(item);     // Published recordings
  }
};
```

### 3. **Dynamic Template Rendering**

#### **Icon**
- 🎵 Regular songs: Music note icon
- 🎤 Published recordings: Microphone icon

#### **Details Shown**

**Regular Song:**
- Title
- Artist
- Tempo (BPM)
- Difficulty badge (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Chord count

**Published Recording:**
- Title
- Date created
- Duration
- Note count
- "👤 User Recording" badge

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Data Flow**
```
1. Songs Tab loads
   ↓
2. filteredSongs computed property combines:
   - regularSongs (predefined songs)
   - publishedSongs (from recordings store)
   ↓
3. Template renders both types:
   - Type guard differentiates
   - Conditional rendering shows appropriate details
   ↓
4. Click handler routes to correct function:
   - selectSong() for regular songs
   - playRecording() for published recordings
```

### **State Management**
```
recordingsStore.publishedSongs
   ↓
allSongsWithRecordings = [...regularSongs, ...publishedSongs]
   ↓
filteredSongs (with search)
   ↓
Songs Tab Display
```

## 🧪 Testing

**To test:**
1. Login to the app
2. Record and save a song
3. Publish it (click "📤 Publish")
4. Open Song Library
5. Go to "Songs" tab
6. ✅ You should see both:
   - Predefined songs (Twinkle Twinkle, All of Me, etc.)
   - Your published recording

**Expected behavior:**
- Search filters both types
- Click on regular song → Loads song chords
- Click on published recording → Plays recording
- Both show "✓ Playing" badge when active
