## ✅ What We've Built

This document summarizes the complete Appwrite integration for iKeys, transforming it from a client-side-only app into a full-stack application with cloud features.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication System** 🔐

- ✅ Secure login/logout
- ✅ Password reset via email
- ✅ Persistent sessions
- ✅ Auto-check authentication on app load

**Updated Components:**
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.vue` - Now uses Appwrite for real authentication
- `src/components/auth/RegisterForm.vue` - Now creates actual user accounts
- `src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.vue` - Sends real password reset emails

2. Create `.env` file with credentials
3. Run `npm install` to install Appwrite SDK
4. Run `npm run dev`

### Production:

2. Add production domain to Appwrite platform settings
3. Set production environment variables in hosting platform (Render, Vercel, etc.)
4. Deploy normally

### Environment Variables in Render:
```
Key: VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
Value: https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented:
- ✅ User-based permissions (owner-only edits)
- ✅ Secure authentication flow
- ✅ Password reset via email
- ✅ HTTPS-only endpoints
- ✅ XSS protection (Vue's default escaping)

### Recommended for Production:
- Enable email verification
- Set up rate limiting in Appwrite
- Add CAPTCHA for registration
- Implement 2FA (future)
- Regular security audits

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Project not found" error:
- Check `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` in `.env`
- Verify project exists in Appwrite console
- Add domain to platform settings

### Recordings not saving:
- Check user is logged in
- Verify database permissions
- Check browser console for errors

### Search not working:
- Ensure fulltext index exists on `title` field
- Verify collection permissions allow read

### Can't publish recordings:
- Check user owns the recording
- Verify update permissions in collection
