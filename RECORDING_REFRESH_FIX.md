# Recording Refresh Fix

## 🐛 Issue
When a user saves a new recording, it doesn't appear immediately in the "My Songs" tab. The user has to switch tabs or refresh for the recording to show up.

## ✅ Solution
Implemented automatic refresh of the recordings list after successful save.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **SongLibraryModal.vue**

**Added `defineExpose`** to expose the refresh method:

```typescript
// Expose methods for parent component to call
defineExpose({
  refreshRecordings: loadMyRecordings,
});
```

**What this does:**
- Allows parent component (`App.vue`) to call the `loadMyRecordings` function
- Refreshes the recordings list from Appwrite

---

### 2. **App.vue**

**Added template ref** to the `SongLibraryModal`:

```vue
<SongLibraryModal
  ref="songLibraryModalRef"
  :songs="songs"
  ...
/>
```

**Added ref variable** in script:

```typescript
// Template refs
const songLibraryModalRef = ref<{ refreshRecordings: () => Promise<void> } | null>(null);
```

**Updated save function** to refresh recordings after success:

```typescript
// Show success toast
toast.success(`Recording "${title}" saved successfully! 🎵`);

// Refresh recordings list in Song Library if it's open and user is logged in
if (showSongLibrary.value && userStore.isLoggedIn && songLibraryModalRef.value) {
  await songLibraryModalRef.value.refreshRecordings();
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before Fix ❌
```
User records → Saves → Toast shows ✅
                      ↓
                 My Songs tab (empty) ❌
                      ↓
          User switches tabs → Refresh triggered
                      ↓
                 Recording appears ✅
```

### After Fix ✅
```
User records → Saves → Toast shows ✅
                      ↓
                 Auto-refresh triggered
                      ↓
                 My Songs tab updates immediately ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

**To test:**
1. Open the app and login
2. Open "Song Library" → Go to "My Songs" tab
3. Close the modal
4. Record some notes on the piano
5. Stop recording and save with a title
6. Open "Song Library" → Go to "My Songs" tab
7. ✅ **Your new recording should appear immediately!**

## 📝 Technical Details

### Why this approach?

**Option 1: Event Bus** ❌
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Global event management overhead

**Option 2: Reactive Store** ❌
- Overkill for this simple case
- Would need to sync with Appwrite

**Option 3: Template Ref + Exposed Method** ✅ (Chosen)
- Simple and direct
- No global state needed
- Parent controls when to refresh
- Vue's built-in reactivity handles the rest

### When does refresh happen?

Refresh is **conditional** - only happens when:
1. ✅ User is logged in (`userStore.isLoggedIn`)
2. ✅ Song Library modal is open (`showSongLibrary.value`)
3. ✅ Modal ref is available (`songLibraryModalRef.value`)

This prevents unnecessary API calls when:
- ❌ Modal is closed
- ❌ User is not logged in
- ❌ User is on a different tab

## 🎉 Result

**Immediate feedback!** Users now see their recordings appear instantly after saving, providing a much better user experience.
